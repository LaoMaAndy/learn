The Zen of Python
by Tim Peters
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
Python was Designed by Guido van Rossum.

Python真言
作者Tim Peters
    漂亮胜于难看。
    显式胜于隐式。
    简单胜于复杂。
    复杂胜于凌乱。
    扁平胜于嵌套。
    分散胜于密集。
    可读性很重要！！！
    即使特例也不能破坏规则。
    虽然实用性胜过纯粹性，但错误处理不应因此忽略，除非显式声明对此忽略。
    面对歧义，拒绝猜测。
    实施方案应该直观，并且有且最好只有一种。
    这样的方案可能一开始并不直观，除非你是van Guido（Python创始人）。
    现在开始比永不开始要好。
    匆忙开始比永不开始更糟。
    如果实施方案难以解释，很可能是个坏方案。
    如果实施方案容易解释，很可能是个好方案。
    命名空间是一个很棒的想法————类似的事情我们要多做一些！
